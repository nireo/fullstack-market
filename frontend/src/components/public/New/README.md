### What is the 'New' folder?
The new folder contains a new type of design for the page. Only reason this is here is because I want to test a sidebar like appearance for the dashboard. Since at the moment the dashboard uses a very simple card type design.

The idea is to have a sidebar design, which all the administration of the shop resides in. The goal is to have tabs for reviews and postings, also a statistics tab for statistics about the shop.
