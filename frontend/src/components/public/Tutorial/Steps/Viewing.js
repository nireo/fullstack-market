        Hello, I'm glad you've decided to take the tutorial. I hope after
        reading this tutorial, you can be a power user of benelov. All the
        basics are in the explore tab. The hole idea of benelov, is to be a free
        market to anyone who wants to start a online business. Since this is the
        case, the site is divided into official postings and community postings.
        The official posts are from benelov staff members, so they're really
        trustworthy. If by any chance, someone on the site happens to scam you,
        report it directly in the reports tab. We will try our best at refunding
        the purchases.{" "}
      </p>

        The post view aims to be as simple as possible, with a clear and
        minimalist interface. On the page you can see the basic info about the
        poster and the post. Every post is required to have a description and
        title. In the future picture preview will be added. Also every post has
        a clear review tab, where the buyers of the product can comment about
        their thoughts related to the product.
